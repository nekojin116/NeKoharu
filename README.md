Koharu introduces a local-first workflow for manga translation, utilizing the power of ML to automate the process. It combines the capabilities of object detection, OCR, inpainting, and LLMs to create a seamless translation experience.

> [!NOTE]
> Koharu runs its vision models and LLMs **locally** on your machine to keep your data private and secure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NeKoharu** is a personal fork that tracks upstream Koharu and adds the extra features listed below. Upstream docs and model guides apply to this fork as well. Features, fixes, and bugs that belong in the original project should go to [koharu-rs/koharu](https://github.com/koharu-rs/koharu).

- [WebGPU-based canvas](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/canvas) for manual cleanup, text placement, and page composition
- [Multilingual text shaping and layout](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/typesetting) with automatic fitting, font fallback, vertical CJK, and right-to-left text
- [Layered PSD export](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/export) for flattened delivery and layered editing
- [Agent-based workflow](https://koharu.rs/en/agent/projects) for project inspection, editing, and pipeline control

## Extra features in NeKoharu

Everything upstream Koharu does, plus:

**Editor and navigation**

- Navigate between pages with the left and right arrow keys.
- Keep the active page visible in the page rail during keyboard navigation.
- Reorder pages by dragging them in the page rail.
- Manually mark chapter starts in the page rail to quickly find chapter boundaries.
- Select multiple layers by dragging a rectangle from an empty canvas area with the select tool; add to the selection with Shift, Ctrl, or Cmd (ported from [upstream PR #1148](https://github.com/koharu-rs/koharu/pull/1148)).
- Browse font choices with the keyboard or pointer to apply each candidate to the selected text, and keep it visible in the list.
- Automatically select the cleanup layer when switching to the brush or eraser tool.

**Project and export**

- Export selected pages as PNG, PSD, or CBZ from the project export menu.
- Merge adjacent split-panel pages into one wide spread from the page menu, keeping their text layers, translations, cleanup layers, and analysis regions.
- Copy and paste selected text layers between pages, preserving their text, placement, and formatting.
- Keep the last eight colors used in the color picker as recent swatches, including colors sampled with the eyedropper (ported from [upstream PR #989](https://github.com/koharu-rs/koharu/pull/989)).

**Translation**

- Optionally translate multiple pages in one request, with a configurable page limit for cross-page name and plot consistency.

## Hardware Acceleration

Koharu supports CUDA and ROCm / HIP on Windows and Linux, Metal on Apple silicon, and Vulkan on Windows and Linux. Keep your graphics driver current; a full CUDA or ROCm SDK installation is not required. See [Runtime and hardware requirements](https://koharu.rs/en/hardware) for model-specific guidance.

### CUDA

CUDA 13.3 requires an NVIDIA Turing-class or newer GPU and an R610 or newer driver. Check NVIDIA's official [CUDA toolkit, driver, and architecture matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/drivers/cuda-toolkit-driver-and-architecture-matrix.html) and install the [latest NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/).

### ROCm / HIP

ROCm 10.0 support depends on the exact AMD GPU, operating system, and driver combination. Check AMD's official [ROCm 10.0.0 compatibility matrix](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-10.0.0/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.html) and install a compatible [AMD driver](https://www.amd.com/en/support).

### Metal

Metal is available on Apple silicon Macs.

### Vulkan

Vulkan is available on Windows and Linux as an alternative to CUDA and ROCm / HIP.

### WebGPU

The editor canvas uses WebGPU and requires a current graphics driver even when inference runs on the CPU.

### CPU

CPU inference is available for supported workloads but is substantially slower.

## Machine Learning Models

Koharu uses separate models for detection, OCR, inpainting, and translation. [Vision and inpainting](https://koharu.rs/en/models/vision) and [translation and generation](https://koharu.rs/en/models/translation) have separate model settings.

### Computer Vision Models

Detection, OCR, and inpainting models are selected separately.

#### Detection and Layout

The detection model finds text regions, speech bubbles, and segmentation masks.

- [Koharu Layout RF-DETR Seg 2XL](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/koharu-layout-rfdetr-seg-2xl-1152)

#### OCR

OCR reads source text from detected regions.

- [PaddleOCR VL 1.6](https://huggingface.co/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR-VL-1.6)
- [Manga OCR](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/manga-ocr)
- [Baberu OCR](https://huggingface.co/genshiai-daichi/baberu-ocr)
- [Hayai OCR](https://huggingface.co/JustANormalTinkerer/hayai-ocr-v2)

#### Inpainting

Inpainting reconstructs the image behind source text before the translation is rendered.

- [FLUX.2 Klein](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/FLUX.2-klein-4B-GGUF)
- [RORem mixed](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/RORem-mixed-GGUF)
- [LaMa](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/lama-manga)
- [AOT GAN](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/aot-inpainting)

### Large Language Models

Translation can use a local language model or a remote API.

## Installation

Download release builds from the [NeKoharu releases page](https://github.com/nekojin116/NeKoharu/releases/latest). [Installation requirements and first launch](https://koharu.rs/en/installation) from upstream Koharu apply to this fork as well.

Builds are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

> [!NOTE]
> The `winget install koharu` and `brew install --cask koharu` packages distribute **upstream** Koharu, not this fork. Install NeKoharu from the releases page above, or build from source (see Development). Builds from either source can open the same projects.

NeKoharu releases are self-updating: the in-app updater checks this repository's releases rather than upstream's.

## Troubleshooting

Startup, runtime, model, and provider errors are covered in [Troubleshooting](https://koharu.rs/en/reference/troubleshooting). Set `RUST_LOG` to `debug` or `trace` for verbose logs:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
RUST_LOG=debug koharu
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:RUST_LOG="debug"; koharu.exe
```

## Development

Platform dependencies and validation commands for local builds are listed in [Development Setup](https://koharu.rs/en/development/setup).

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.97.1 or later (Rust 2024 edition)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3.14 or later
- [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) 22.1.8 or later

### Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

```bash
bun dev
```

### Build

```bash
bun run build
```

The executable is written to `target/release`.
